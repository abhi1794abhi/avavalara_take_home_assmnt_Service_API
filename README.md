# avavalara_take_home_assmnt_Service_API
This exercise is your chance to show us how you would design a small JSON based API service. For this exercise, we need to develop a small service that will help our engineers schedule running jobs ensuring their runtimes do not overlap. Given two date ranges, this service should return a response letting the caller know if these ranges overlap.
